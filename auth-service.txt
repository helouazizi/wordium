🔑 Putting it all together

Spring Web → exposes REST endpoints

Spring Security → secures your endpoints

Spring Data JPA → stores users and roles in DB

Eureka Client → registers service for discovery

JWT (jjwt) → issues/validates tokens for stateless auth

Validation → ensures request data is correct

This combination gives you a production-ready auth-service for microservices.
